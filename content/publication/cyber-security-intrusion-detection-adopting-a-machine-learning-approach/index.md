abstract: The Intrusion network (INetwork) connects systems, applications, data
  storage, and services that may be a new gateway for cyber-attacks as they
  continuously offer services in the organization. Currently, software piracy
  and malware attacks are high risks to compromise the security of the Intrusion
  network. These intrusions may steal important information that causes economic
  and reputational damages. In order to identify harmful activity on target
  computers, a number of systems currently exist; yet occasionally an external
  user will produce malicious behavior and get unauthorized access to the
  victims' computers. This behavior is referred to as nefarious actions or an
  intruder. In this paper, we have proposed a combined Machine learning approach
  to detect pirated software and malware-infected files across the Intrusion
  network. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied in IDS in order to
  identify and classify security threats. Numerous machine learning and soft
  computing techniques are designed to detect the activities in real-time
  network log audit data. KKDDCUP99 and NLSKDD most utilized data sets to detect
  the Intruder on the benchmark data set. Two different techniques have been
  proposed a signature with detection and anomaly-based detection. The
  experimental analysis demonstrates SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, and ANN algorithms with
  various data sets and demonstrates system performance in the real-time network
  environment.
